# CVE-2020-15931
#### Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner 4.1 Domain Admin Account Credential Disclosure Vulnerability

## es
Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner (ALE) before 5.1 allows an unauthenticated, remote adversary to trigger a connection to an attacker-controlled system and capture the NTLMv1/v2 challenge-response of an account with domain administrator privileges. The domain administrator account would already be configured with the product as required for installation. An adversary can exploit this by generating a single Kerberos Pre-Authentication Failed (Event ID 4771) event on a domain controller.

## Credit
